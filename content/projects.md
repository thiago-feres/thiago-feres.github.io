    <strong>Development of a Business Management Dashboard with Streamlit</strong><br>
    In this project, concepts of Python programming, data manipulation, strategic thinking,
     and business logic were applied, along with web development tools such as Streamlit 
     and GitHub, to develop a management dashboard featuring the key metrics of a food 
     delivery marketplace company in India. The final outcome of the project was a dashboard 
     hosted in a Cloud environment and made available via a web link. The dashboard can be accessed 
     from any internet-connected device.<br>
 <strong>The tools used were:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Jupyter Lab</li>
        <li>Streamlit</li>
        <li>GitHub</li>

    <strong>Machine Learning Essay</strong><br>
    In this project, the main concepts of training, parameter tuning, and the balance between overfitting and underfitting of several Machine Learning algorithms in the tasks of classification, regression, and clustering were explored through a Machine Learning essay. The final result of the project was a dashboard showing the performance of these Machine Learning algorithms, based on variations of the key parameters of each algorithm that control the state of overfitting and underfitting.<br>
 <strong>The tools used were:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.8 and Scikit-learn</li>
        <li>Classification algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score</li>
        <li>Regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression Lasso, Linear Regression Ridge, Linear Regression Elastic Net, Polynomial Regression Lasso, Polynomial Regression Ridge, and Polynomial Regression Elastic Net</li>
        <li>Performance metrics: R2, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE</li>
        <li>Clustering algorithms: K-Means and Affinity Propagation</li>
        <li>Performance metric: Silhouette Score</li>
    </ul>
