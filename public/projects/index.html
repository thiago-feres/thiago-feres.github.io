    Development of a Business Management Dashboard with Streamlit
    In this project, concepts of Python programming, data manipulation, strategic thinking,
     and business logic were applied, along with web development tools such as Streamlit 
     and GitHub, to develop a management dashboard featuring the key metrics of a food 
     delivery marketplace company in India. The final outcome of the project was a dashboard 
     hosted in a Cloud environment and made available via a web link. The dashboard can be accessed 
     from any internet-connected device.
 The tools used were:
    
        Python
        Jupyter Lab
        Streamlit
        GitHub
        Git

    Machine Learning Essay
    In this project, the main concepts of training, parameter tuning, and the balance between overfitting and underfitting of several Machine Learning algorithms in the tasks of classification, regression, and clustering were explored through a Machine Learning essay. The final result of the project was a dashboard showing the performance of these Machine Learning algorithms, based on variations of the key parameters of each algorithm that control the state of overfitting and underfitting.
 The tools used were:
    
        Python 3.8 and Scikit-learn
        Classification algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
        Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
        Regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression Lasso, Linear Regression Ridge, Linear Regression Elastic Net, Polynomial Regression Lasso, Polynomial Regression Ridge, and Polynomial Regression Elastic Net
        Performance metrics: R2, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
        Clustering algorithms: K-Means and Affinity Propagation
        Performance metric: Silhouette Score
